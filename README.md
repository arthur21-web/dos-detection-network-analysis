# dos-detection-network-analysis
Research project on detecting and mitigating Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using network traffic analysis with GNS3, Suricata IDS, EveBox and Kali Linux (LOIC).


# 🚀 Denial of Service Detection Using Network Traffic Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores methods to detect and mitigate **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks** in a simulated environment.  
The system was built using **GNS3** for network simulation, **Suricata IDS** for real-time detection, and **EveBox** as a lightweight GUI for monitoring alerts.  

Additional tools include **Wireshark** for deep packet inspection and **Kali Linux (LOIC, hping3)** to simulate DoS attacks.  

⚠️ **Note:** This project is still a work in progress and active development is ongoing.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **GNS3** – Network simulation  
- **Suricata** – Intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS)  
- **EveBox** – Lightweight web GUI for Suricata logs  
- **Wireshark** – Traffic capture & forensic analysis  
- **Kali Linux (LOIC, hping3)** – DoS attack simulation  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Simulate DoS attacks in a controlled virtual environment.  
- Detect anomalies in traffic using **Suricata rules**.  
- Visualize real-time alerts with **EveBox**.  
- Compare packet-level analysis (Wireshark) vs. automated detection (Suricata).  

---

## 📊 Outcome  
The project demonstrated that open-source tools such as **Suricata + EveBox** provide effective **real-time detection** of DoS attacks while tools like Wireshark are more suited for forensic analysis.  

⚠️ **Work in Progress:** Additional experiments and improvements are ongoing.
